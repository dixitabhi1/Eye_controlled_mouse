# Eye_controlled_mouse
This project implements a real-time eye-tracking mouse controller using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI. It allows users to control the cursor with eye movement and click using blinks, offering a hands-free way to interact with a computer â€” especially useful for people with mobility impairments.
